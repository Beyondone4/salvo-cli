# Salvo CLI

Salvo CLI is a command-line interface tool for the Salvo web framework. It helps streamline the process of setting up a new Salvo project by generating a template structure.

## Installation

Before you can use the Salvo CLI, you need to install it. Assuming you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can install Salvo CLI with the following command:

```bash
cargo install salvo-cli
```
## Usage
To create a new Salvo project, use the new command followed by the name of your project:

```bash
salvo-cli new project_name
```
This will create a new directory named project_name, and it will set up a basic project structure suitable for a Salvo-based application.

## Update
```bash
cargo install --force salvo-cli
```
